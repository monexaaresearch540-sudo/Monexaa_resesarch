# Monexaa React App

A minimal React (JavaScript) scaffold created for you.

How to run (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
cd "D:\Durgesh\Monexaa-Research"
npm install
npm start
```

Notes:
- This project uses `react-scripts` configuration. If you prefer Vite or another bundler, I can convert it.
- Files added in `src`:
  - `pages/home.js` — home page
  - `components/Header.js` — header component
  - `components/Footer.js` — footer component
